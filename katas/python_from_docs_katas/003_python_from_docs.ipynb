    "# PYTHON\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and a wide range of other applications. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility, and is a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed at runtime by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code that can be run directly on a computer's hardware. This makes Python programs easy to write and debug, but also means that they may not be as fast or efficient as programs written in compiled languages like C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a large standard library that provides a wide range of built-in functionality, as well as a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that allow developers to do everything from building web applications to working with data and machine learning."
