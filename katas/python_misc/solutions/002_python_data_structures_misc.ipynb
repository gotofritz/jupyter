    "\n",
    "In Python, tuples are a handy data structure for grouping together items. However, when tuples are used to store complex data, accessing their elements by index can make the code less readable. Named tuples, introduced as part of Python's `collections` module and enhanced with type annotations in the `typing` module, offer a solution by allowing you to access tuple elements with names, making your code more self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to refactor a given piece of code that uses regular tuples to store employee information. The refactored code should use named tuples to achieve better readability and self-documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current code snippet uses regular tuples to store information about employees, including their name, role, and years of experience. It then prints out this information in a formatted string.\n",
    "2. Refactor Using Named Tuples\n",
    "   1. Define a named tuple, `Employee`, with three fields: `name`, `role`, and `years`\n",
    "   1. Add type annotations to each field and to `Employee`\n",
    "   1. Replace the list of regular tuples with a list of `Employee` named tuples\n",
    "   1. Modify the loop that prints employee information so that it accesses the employee details using field names instead of tuple indexing\n",
    "3. Ensure your refactored code prints the same employee information as the original code, but utilizes the named tuple for improved readability\n"
