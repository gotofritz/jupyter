    "\n",
    "In the breadth-first search algorithm, you look for a node that satisfies a particular condition by exploring the graph in concentric layers or levels. The breadth-first search algorithm ensures that you‚Äôll eventually explore all connected nodes in a graph while searching for one that satisfies the desired condition. You start traversing the graph at an arbitrarily chosen source node unless the graph is a tree data structure, in which case you typically start at the root node of that tree. At each step, you visit all immediate neighbors of the current node before going deeper. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reuse `as_cities_map` and `as_cities_graph`\n",
    "2. nx has a breadth-first search function, `nx.bfs_tree`. Use it to identify the closest neighbour of `CITY` which was granted city status in the XXth century\n",
    "    1. Use `print_name` to show what the loop is doing\n",
    "    1. Use the `is_twentieth_century` to find the city and print \n",
    "3. The actual order of the neighbours is unknown unless you specify. Let's do that\n",
    "    1. function `order` does the orderinging\n",
    "        1. it returns an iterable...\n",
    "        1. ...and orders by latitude (could be anything really)\n",
    "    1. add that ordering to the `nx.bfs_tree` function\n",
    "4. Use the Queue from earlier to implement your own BFS\n",
    "    1. Create `breadth_first_traverse` which does breadth-first traverse of QUEUE\n",
    "        1. Initialise the FIFO queue with source\n",
    "        1. To ensure no infinite loops, keep track of visited nodes and skip them\n",
    "        1. `breadth_first_traverse` is an iterator that returns the latest dequeued node\n",
    "            1. (HINT: walrus operator)\n",
    "        1. once a node is dealt with, add its neightbours to the queue\n",
    "    1. Create `breadth_first_search` which iterates through `breadth_first_traverse` and returns the first node that matches\n",
    "    1. call `breadth_first_search` with the same parameters as the `nx.bfs_tree` version and check that results match\n",
    "5. Add the `order_by` clause, same as `nx.bfs_tree` example, and call function again using `order` for it. It should match previous example\n",
    "    1. Note that the order_by function is slightly different - it takes a single City, as we are using simple list sorting\n",
