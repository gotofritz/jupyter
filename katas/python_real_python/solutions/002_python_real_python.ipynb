    "**Parallelism** consists of performing multiple operations at the same time. **Multiprocessing** is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer’s central processing units (CPUs, or cores). Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound for loops and mathematical computations usually fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concurrency** is a slightly broader term than parallelism. It suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner. (There’s a saying that concurrency does not imply parallelism.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threading** is a concurrent execution model whereby multiple threads take turns executing tasks. One process can contain multiple threads. Python has a complicated relationship with threading thanks to its GIL, but that’s beyond the scope of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "async IO is a single-threaded, single-process design: it uses **cooperative multitasking**. It has been said in other words that async IO gives a feeling of concurrency despite using a single thread in a single process. Coroutines (a central feature of async IO) can be scheduled concurrently, but they are not inherently concurrent."

You can largely follow the patterns from the two scripts above, with slight changes\n",

    "There is an alternative structure that can also work with async IO: a number of producers, which are not associated with each other, add items to a queue. Each producer may add multiple items to the queue at staggered, random, unannounced times. A group of consumers pull items from the queue as they show up, greedily and without waiting for any other signal. One use-case for queues (as is the case here) is for the queue to act as a transmitter for producers and consumers that aren’t otherwise directly chained or associated with each other.\n",
