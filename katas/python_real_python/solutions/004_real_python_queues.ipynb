    "\n",
    "In the breadth-first search algorithm, you look for a node that satisfies a particular condition by exploring the graph in concentric layers or levels. The breadth-first search algorithm ensures that you’ll eventually explore all connected nodes in a graph while searching for one that satisfies the desired condition. You start traversing the graph at an arbitrarily chosen source node unless the graph is a tree data structure, in which case you typically start at the root node of that tree. At each step, you visit all immediate neighbors of the current node before going deeper. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reuse `as_cities_map` and `as_cities_graph`\n",
    "2. nx has a breadth-first search function, `nx.bfs_tree`. Use it to identify the closest neighbour of `CITY` which was granted city status in the XXth century\n",
    "    1. Use `print_name` to show what the loop is doing\n",
    "    1. Use the `is_twentieth_century` to find the city and print \n",

    "    1. call `breadth_first_search` with the same parameters as the `nx.bfs_tree` version and check that results match\n",

    "\n",
    "In many cases, the fewer the nodes on the path from source to destination, the shorter the distance. Traversing the graph using the breadth-first approach will produce a path guaranteed to have the fewest nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use networkx to reveal all the shortest paths between two cities, which will have the same minimal length\n",
    "    1. Import cities_map and cities_graph as earlier\n",
    "    1. Create two cities nodes for aberdeen and perth\n",
    "    1. nx has a builtin method for that, use it. Start enumerator from 1 and not the default 0\n",
    "1. Write your own version, `shortest_path` (which only finds the first shortest path)\n",
    "    1. Base it on `breadth_first_traverse_2`, but keep a dictionary of previous nodes\n",
    "        1. Keep a trail of nodes in `previous_nodes`\n",
    "        1. When you find the destination, retrace the trail with a new function `retrace` (next step)\n",
    "    1. `retrace` takes a dictionary of City -> City and returns a path through them\n",
    "        1. Store the results in a standard Deque, no need for more\n",
    "        1. load the destination in a var `current`, and loop through `previous_nodes` to find the trail.\n",
    "        1. Unshift into the deque as you find it\n",
    "        1. Ends when the `current` is either None or the source\n",
    "    1. Call the function, should be the same as one of the paths\n",
    "        1. Note that you get a different result if you order nodes differently\n",
    "1. `shortest_path` can also be used to find out whether two nodes are connected or not\n"
