    "**Parallelism** consists of performing multiple operations at the same time. **Multiprocessing** is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer’s central processing units (CPUs, or cores). Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound for loops and mathematical computations usually fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concurrency** is a slightly broader term than parallelism. It suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner. (There’s a saying that concurrency does not imply parallelism.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threading** is a concurrent execution model whereby multiple threads take turns executing tasks. One process can contain multiple threads. Python has a complicated relationship with threading thanks to its GIL, but that’s beyond the scope of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "async IO is a single-threaded, single-process design: it uses **cooperative multitasking**. It has been said in other words that async IO gives a feeling of concurrency despite using a single thread in a single process. Coroutines (a central feature of async IO) can be scheduled concurrently, but they are not inherently concurrent."
